SpeakUp is a social media platform that is designed to help individuals speak out about their problems, worries, and concerns in their states and city.

The platform is built on the idea of sharing problems in their areas, and its user-friendly interface makes it easy for people to communicate their thoughts and feelings about their problems that they are facing in their city. Users can post text, photos.
